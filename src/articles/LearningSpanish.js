          Learning languages is fun, especially when you learn the funny sayings
          and insults of another culture! This blog post shares two key ideas:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>How I automated most of my learning</b> by using a default
              language on my phone and by building a habit.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Fun slang and mild insults</b> - You just don't come across
              slang or phrases unless you've spent a significant amount of time
              with native speakers. So here are some phrases I learnt while
              spending time with my partners family!
            </li>
          </ol>
          Hope this helps you on your Spanish-learning journey!

        <h2 id="approach">Learning approach</h2>

        <p>
          I made learning as automated and easy as possible. These baby steps
          improved my Spanish so that I was comfortable with causal conversation
          within a year. Here's what I did.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>I changed my phone's language to Spanish</b> (kudos to Rene).
            This change meant that I was automatically learning and practicing
            Spanish, <b>everytime I used my phone</b>. It might sound like a
            drastic change, but actually it's pretty easy to use your phone in
            another language. Most UI's are well designed these days, meaning
            you can easily guess the meaning of buttons in Apps (eg{" "}
            <i>Buscar aqui</i> on the search bar on Google Maps would be "Search
            here").
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>
              I built a habit of using{" "}
              <a href="https://www.memrise.com/">Memrise</a> while commuting
              everyday
            </b>
            . Back in 2017, I was taking a train to a client's office everyday.
            By using this time, and forming a simple habit, I got small gains
            everyday (I highly recommend reading{" "}
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business/dp/081298160X">
              The Power of Habit
            </a>
            ). Memrise is a fantastic app. It uses spaced repetition, recordings
            of native speakers and it taught me phrases used everday in Spanish.
            Its learning algorithm will test you at the right timings to train
            your memory effectively. I cannot recommend it enough (its much
            better than Duolingo).

        </ol>

        <h2 id="slang">Common slang and phrases</h2>

        <p>
